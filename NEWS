CoreGTK 3.10.0 - 2015-06-28
===============================================================================

CoreGTK 3.10.0 is the newly re-written GTK+ 3 version.

This version of CoreGTK provides bindings for the API exposed by these libraries:
  * gtk+ 3.10.8 (mostly GtkWidget and down)

There is no API stability guarantee for now, but we try to keep breaking
changes to a minimum.

New features and enhancements
-----------------------------

  * Moved from GTK+ 2 to GTK+ 3
  * Base code generation on GObject Introspection instead of a mix of automated source parsing and manual correction

Changes
-------

  * Now preferring the use of glib data types over boxed OpenStep/Cocoa objects (i.e. gint vs NSNumber)
  * A few APIs have been removed or updated to work better with this new approach

Bug fixes
